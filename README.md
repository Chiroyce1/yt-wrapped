Client side YouTube Wrapped (like Spotify Wrapped) app that shows you an overview of the number of videos and channels you've watched this year + supports custom date ranges.

## Contributons

Contributons are very welcome! Head over to the [issues](https://github.com/Chiroyce1/yt-wrapped/issues) page and pick a feature to work on, or create a [new issue](https://github.com/Chiroyce1/yt-wrapped/issues/new) if you want to request a feature (should be within the scope of what this can do client side).

## General todo list

- Clean up data parsing/filtering code (very messy + some weird copilot code)
- Add more stats (giv ideas pls)
- More in-depth over-time analysis (what channels you've watched more over time and which ones less, etc..)
